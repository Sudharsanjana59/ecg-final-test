   This is the master dataset. It is the single source of truth used by:
     - game.js      (to build each level's puzzle)
     - admin.html   (to display / export the dataset for the admin)
   An admin can edit waveform definitions, hints, and level composition here
   without touching any game logic.

   20 rhythms, 20 levels — one unique topic per level, no repeats: normal
   sinus rhythm, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, ventricular
   tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes, 2nd-degree
   AV block, complete heart block (AV dissociation), RBBB, LBBB, Brugada
   syndrome, Long QT syndrome, WPW syndrome, sick sinus syndrome, LVH, RVH,
   premature atrial contraction, premature ventricular contraction,
   bigeminy, and trigeminy.

  PVC:      { id: "PVC",      name: "Premature Ventricular Contraction", difficulty: "medium", rate: "60-100 bpm + early beats",
    hint: "An early, wide, bizarre QRS appears with no P wave in front of it at all, followed by a longer 'compensatory' pause before the normal rhythm resumes." },
